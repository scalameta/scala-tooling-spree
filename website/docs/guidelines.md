### Before the Spree

#### Registration
If you want to take part in the Scala Tooling Spree, please register using [this form](https://forms.gle/yUurzS2KiM2Kwnpc6). If the form is closed, it may be because registrations haven't opened yet. The form usually closes two days before the event, but feel free to register as long as it's still open.

If you registered but can no longer attend, please send a quick email to tooling-spree@virtuslab.com.

#### Preparation
A day before the spree, you'll receive an email with a link to the Google Meet where the event will take place, as well as a link to a spreadsheet with assignments.

In the assignments file, you'll find information about your team, the issue you've been assigned, and the repository where the fix should **most likely** be made.  
Feel free to read through the issue in advance and make sure you understand it.

If this is your first time working with the repository, please fork it, clone it, and ensure it works in your IDE before the spree — especially if you plan to be the one writing the code.  
If your repository is Scala 3 compiler (scala/scala3) [follow the IDE setup guide](https://dotty.epfl.ch/docs/contributing/setting-up-your-ide.html) for the presentation compiler module.

### During the Spree
After introductions, teams will get 90 minutes to work on their issues.  
Once time is up, each team will briefly explain what their issue was, what they accomplished, and what remains to be done.

### After the Spree
Make sure to create a PR or draft PR with any relevant changes your team made.  
Please remember to include your whole team as co-authors in the commit. If you're unsure how to do that, here is a [GitHub guide](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/committing-changes-to-your-project/creating-and-editing-commits/creating-a-commit-with-multiple-authors).

If your team didn’t manage to create a fix, please add any relevant findings or insights in a comment on the GitHub issue.

Finally, decide whether you'd like to continue working on the issue in your spare time, or prefer the Metals team to finish it. Add that information either to the PR or directly on the issue.  
If you need help completing the fix, don’t hesitate to ask!

**Remember to join the [Metals Discord server](https://discord.gg/DwTc8xbNDd) to chat with maintainers and other Tooling Spree participants!**
